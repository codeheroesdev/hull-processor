- Paste the URL for your Heroku deployment, or use ours : `https://hull-processor.herokuapp.com/`

### Developing :

- Fork
- Install

```sh
npm install -g gulp
npm install
gulp
```

### Notes

1. Due to merging and diff calculating strategy, following use scenario can lead to an unexpected result:
    ```js
    user.traits.custom_ids = ["A", "B", "C"];
    traits({ custom_ids: ["A", "B"] });
    // processor ignores removing that array element
    ```

### Logs

  These are log messages that are specific for Processor Connector :

    * compute.user.computed - logged after successful computing traits about user in user-update
    * compute.account.computed - logged after successful computing traits about account in user-update
    * compute.account.link - logged after successful linking for account
    * compute.user.computed - logged after successful computing
    * compute.user.error - logged when encountered error during compute operation
    * compute.console.log - these are additional logs that should be displayed after compute
    * compute.error - general logging about errors that encountered during updating user

    * fetch.user.events.error - logged when encountered error during user events fetch
    * fetch.user.segments.error - logged when encountered error during user segments fetch
    * fetch.user.report.error - logged when encountered problems during search for user reports
    * fetch.user.error - logged when encountered error during user fetch
